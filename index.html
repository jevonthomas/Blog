			<p><blockquote>"…You end up choosing a career path that does not really suit you. Your desire and interest slowly wane and your work suffers for it…" –Robert Greene, Mastery</blockquote></p>

				<p>During a quick meeting with my operations manager, he gave me and my colleagues a quick rundown of our shift’s current performance, followed by tasks for us to carry out for the rest of the shift. After the meeting, we all departed with haste to carry out the tasks he issued to us all, but my departure was quickly halted by my manager asking me to stand by. He wanted me to stand by to discuss an issue from earlier in the shift, but shortly after we spoke about that he shifted into the subject of my overall performance from his perspective. He spoke on a lot of different aspects to what he has witnessed about me, and I agreed with all the points he made. Overall, my performance was up and down. Sometimes I show how good of a manager I can be, and other times I do not. One thing that that really stood out to me was that he said I am very capable of performing the job, but I often seem to be at odds with myself because there is a part of me that would rather be doing something else. I was shocked, a bit nervous, and relieved all at the same time by the fact that he understood this about myself. This has been the case ever since I stepped foot into the US Military Academy, and my work has always suffered for it.</p>

				<p>While at the academy, I struggled to graduate and came close to getting kicked out on a few occasions due to low academic grades. I chose to major in Business Management because it was considered the easy major. I was on academic probation at the time, and figured that I did not want to be academic probation my entire time there, so I went against my interest for the <em>easy</em> route. I quickly realized that if I’m not truly interested in a subject, it is difficult for me to learn it despite how <em>easy</em> it is supposed to be. Needless to say I remained on academic probation my entire time there, and had to spend my summers there, making up classes that I failed during the semester. Not only was my academic performance low, but my military performance was poor as well. Every training exercise, I received low ratings. The only thing I had good going for me was my athletic performance. I was a very skilled boxer and my fitness levels was up to par with the various physical fitness challenges we had to overcome.</p>

				<p>This pattern of poor performance continued into my military career, with me ultimately not receiving my promotion to captain twice and having to end my active duty service. I had some success, but my overall performance kept me from getting promoted. Looking back on my performance, I can honestly say I did not deserve to get promoted.</p>

				<p>There was nothing within my current career path suited my <strong>true self</strong>. My passions, talents, and even personality are not utilized or effective in my current career path. I chose this life because I have a tendency to go with the flow and not think of how my decisions will dictate my future. At the time, it seemed like it was my destiny to go to the academy simply because everything just fell into place and I got in with minimal effort. I had everyone’s support, unlike I have ever had before. They announced my admittance into the academy over my school’s intercom system for all to hear. It felt like all the stars aligned and I was on my way to discover the calling that God has for my life. That feeling, however, was quickly diminished by how difficult and unfulfilling life was for me. As I continued down this path, I felt myself losing touch with who I truly am. It was very depressing and I found myself spending my weeks looking forward to the 2-3 hours of free time I would have on days off and just getting through the rest of my time.</p>

				<p>That part of me that wants to do something else has always drawn me to more creative activities. My career has me doing the opposite and there lies the conflict. In the past, however, I did attempt a career change. With my talents and interests, I knew I was best suited for Front End Web Development and attempted to chart a path to that career field. When I was in the Army, I subscribed to Team Treehouse, but ended up cancelling my subscription because I did not have an external monitor. Silly, but that really bugged me because I would have to keep minimizing the browser to practice what I was learning in Dream Weaver. I also enrolled into the Art Institute, but unenrolled because I felt that I knew everything that was being taught to me and I was just wasting money.</p>

				<p>I’m 30 years old now, and despite my past performances I have had a lot of successes in my professional life. Now, I just want something that is personally rewarding to me. I want my career to be something that will allow me to be my truest self. I want to be a Front End Web Developer and despite my abandonment of this pursuit in the past, I will attempt it once more.</p>
